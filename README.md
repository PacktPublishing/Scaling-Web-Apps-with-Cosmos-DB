## About the Video Course
Data is exploding all over the place and your application needs an update for its database. You need to accommodate incoming data without being involved in every small detail. Yes! You can do that with Azure Cosmos DB - the globally distributed, multi-model database service offered by Microsoft Azure to serve your applications on planet-scale. Azure Cosmos DB is a fast and flexible globally replicated database, well-suited for IoT, gaming, retail, and operational logging applications. 

In this course, we’ll show you how to create and integrate your Azure Cosmos DB with the different NoSQL Databases. This course has got everything, from finding the right database for your data and your different workloads to the ease of administration, scalability, and SLA that you can rely on. With the click of a button, Azure Cosmos DB enables you to elastically and independently scale throughput and storage across any number of Azure's geographic regions.
You’ll see how Cosmos DB is the best choice for your cloud database. With the skills we pass on, you’ll be able to solve challenges and problems such as fixing the database model, availability, scalability, latency, data schemas, and others. In no time, you’ll learn to build your application with Cosmos DB the best cloud database while minimizing your administration and maintaining your availability and scalability.
